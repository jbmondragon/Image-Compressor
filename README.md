## 🧩 Introduction

This project compresses image data using Huffman Coding. The application converts the RGB values of an image into hexadecimal, calculates their frequency, builds a Huffman tree, and encodes the data as binary. This reduces redundancy and overall file size.

---

## ✨ Features

- Select an image to compress.
- Extract RGB and convert to Hex values.
- Generate and store Huffman-encoded data.
- Decompress and view the original image.
- Compression and decompression using BitSet for efficiency.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jbmondragon/Image-Compressor.git
cd Image-Compressor
```

### 2️⃣ Open in VS Code

- Ensure the **Java Extension Pack** is installed.
- Navigate to the `SourceCode/` folder.
- Open `Main.java`.

### 3️⃣ Run the Application

- Click the **Run Java** button (top-right), or  
- Press **F6**.

### 4️⃣ Build a JAR File (Optional)

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → Open **Command Palette**.
- Search: **Java: Export Jar**.
- Choose `Main` as the main class.
- Select all required files.
- Output: `Image-Compressor.jar`.

### 5️⃣ Run the JAR File

```bash
java -jar Image-Compressor.jar
```

Or double-click the `.jar` file (if Java is installed).

> ⚠️ **Requires Java 21 or higher**

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Choose an image to compress.
3. RGB pixel values are extracted and converted to hexadecimal.
4. A Huffman tree is built based on frequency.
5. Image is encoded using Huffman codes and saved as a binary file.
6. Decompressed image can be generated by decoding Huffman codes back to RGB.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

- RGB values extracted from image.
- Converted to hexadecimal values.
- Frequency of each hex value is calculated.
- Huffman Tree is constructed based on frequency.
- Binary Huffman codes are written using `BitSet`.
- Decompression uses a reverse map to retrieve original pixel values.

---

## 🧮 Algorithm / Design

### Main Algorithms:

- `dataExtraction`: Extract RGB & convert to hex.
- `HuffmanTree`: Build Huffman coding tree.
- `compressImage()`: Encode image and write using `BitSet`.
- `DecompressImage()`: Reconstruct original pixels from binary Huffman codes.

---

## 📊 Data / Dataset

- Supports most common image formats: **BMP**, **PNG**, **TIFF**.
- Extracts per-pixel color data (RGB → Hex).
- Frequency map of pixel values is created for Huffman coding.
